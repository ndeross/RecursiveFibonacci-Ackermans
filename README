The recursive fibonacci function was easy to impliment but its efficency is
subpar. It takes much longer to reach Fib(50) because it has to continue to
call on itself in an exponential manner. 

The non-recursive loop based function was difficult to impliment and getting
it to work correctly took some trial and error, but once running proved to
be much more efficent in terms of time to calculate Fib(50) in that it only
took 1 microsecond compared to the recursive's 21 full seconds.
